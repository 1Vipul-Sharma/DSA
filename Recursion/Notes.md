Try to make Input smaller
OR
identify - choices => decision

Make the recursion tree (nodes sirf recursive function ko indicate karne ke liye banate not for simple ones)

first try to take decisions (ip op wala method chlega) (Take note take wala)

if unable then try to reduce input size ( IBH wala chlega)

Approaches for recusrion questions

=====================================
for medium

ip op method

we maintain op and ip

            op="" ip="ab"
        /                   \
    /                           \

op="" ip="b" ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, op="a" ip="b"

kind of input space small karte jarhe h

choices h decision lerhe h usi basis par
basically yehi h suru ke index se decide karte chlenge ek baar generate krenge bina liye ek baar lenge

Is type ke method me sabse pehle try to make a recursion tree then write code

jab logic nhi likh pare ho to koi basic example lo tree bnao and then try to generalize it

=======================================

=======================================
mainly for easy
IBH(induction base hypothesis)

void print(n){
//Base
if(n==1){
cout<<"1";
return ;
}

//Hypothesis
print(n-1);

//Induction
cout<<n;
}

print(7)
|
print(6)
|

EK to ese soch sakte
khud se niche wali cheez hame shi answer degi ye maan ke chalo
bas apna step shi karo niche wale ko call karo wo already shi answer degi esa ham maan chuke h
bas last me base condition shi likhni h

isse kaam na chle to try karo
n se n-1 ki transaction me kya hora h n-1 => n me aane ke lie kya karna hoga

# ========================================

DP
choice diagram

==========================================

# Try to check steps before calling recursion If it is valid to call or not

# break bigger into similar smaller problems ko recursion handle karlega

# Try out all possible combination

‚úÖ How to Start Thinking in Recursion
Try to make the input smaller

OR identify all choices and take decisions accordingly

üîÅ Two Key Approaches to Recursion

1. Input-Output Method (Good for medium-level problems)
   Maintain two parts:

Input ‚Üí What is left to process

Output ‚Üí What has been built so far

Make a Recursion Tree

Each node represents a recursive call

Helps visualize how choices are made

Especially useful when you have multiple choices at each step

Example:

text
Copy
Edit
Input = "ab"
Output = ""

Step 1:
op="" ip="ab"
/ \
 "a" "b" "" "b"

Then further calls...
Try to generate combinations by making decisions:

One branch: Take the current element

Another branch: Skip it

Useful for problems like subsets, permutations, combinations, etc.

2. IBH Method (Induction, Base, Hypothesis) ‚Äî Good for easy-level problems
   Think recursively:

Base Condition: When to stop

Hypothesis: Assume the recursive call works for n-1

Induction Step: Use the n-1 solution to build the n solution

Example:

cpp
Copy
Edit
void print(int n) {
if(n == 1) {
cout << 1;
return;
}
print(n-1); // Hypothesis
cout << n; // Induction
}
Think like:
"If I assume print(n-1) gives the correct result, what do I do to get print(n)?"

When this doesn't help:

Try to figure out the transition from n-1 to n

What step converts the smaller input into the current one?

üîç Checklist When Stuck in Recursion
Try Input-Output approach first (make a recursion tree)

Then, try IBH if it's a straightforward, single-path recursion

If both fail, pick a small example, draw the recursion tree, and try to generalize

üß† General Recursion Strategy
Check validity before calling recursion (Boundary or constraint checks)

Break bigger problems into similar smaller ones

Try all possible combinations (especially in backtracking)

Use recursion to explore possibilities, then backtrack if needed

üßÆ Time Complexity vs Constraints
Rule of Thumb (CPU Power Constraint)
Time Complexity Max Input Size n (Approx.)
O(n^2) n <= 10^4
O(2^n) n <= 20
O(n!) n <= 11

üí° A modern CPU can perform around 10^8 operations per second.

Make sure your total operations do not exceed this to avoid TLE.

üí° DP Tip
Try drawing a choice diagram.

If overlapping subproblems exist, go for Memoization or Tabulation.
